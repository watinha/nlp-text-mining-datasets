2,"Exposure, knowledge or skill the computer literacy dilemma
There was a time when computer knowledge was so esoteric that only
specialists needed to be educated. Only large organizations had computers
and skills were needed only by the professional staff. Now the scene
has changed. Computers are being used in the smallest of firms. Today
there are millions of computers in homes, and there are offices with
more computers and/or terminals than employees. There is some possibility
that in the future all financial transactions and much shopping will
be done by computer. Thus it is obvious that computer literacy is
needed by all people. The question is not whether but rather what
kind of education is required. There are three levels of understanding
that may be imparted in education. One can teach a subject to the
level of a basic understanding or general knowledge. Or one can provide
detailed knowledge. Finally, one can develop in the student the ability
to make skillful use of the subject area. Music appreciation, counterpoint
and private vocal lessons illustrate the differences in one field
of study. In curriculum development in business we tend to solve
the question of depth of knowledge this way. All students are required
to have a general understanding of the business core and a detailed
knowledge of a major field. In addition, we expect that skills be
developed in communications and quantitative methods. We carried
over this pattern into data processing. However, we didn't know whether
DP was a quantitative area requiring skill development or not. Thus
we have Introduction to Data Processing courses that develop a programming
skill in some language and others that just talk about programming
but don't do any of it. There is substantial disagreement among educators
as to the correct course of action. This lack of agreement, as well
as a belated entry into DP education, has resulted in a limited and
uneven computer education in colleges of business. Our graduates
vary from computer illiterate to very skillful user. What to do about
this situation is the focus of this study.","Exposure, knowledge or skill the computer literacy dilemma",0
3,"A view of database system performance measures
Database systems allow quick creation of performance problems. The
goal of database systems is to allow the computer-illiterate to write
complex and complete applications. It is the job of the system to
translate a high-level description of data and procedures into efficient
algorithms. The REAL performance metric of a system is how successfully
it meets these goals. Practitioners use a much narrower definition
of system performance. They assume a standard workload and measure
performance by peak throughput and by dollar cost per transaction.
Although many vendors have “private” performance measures, Bitton,
Dewitt, and Turbyfill were the first to publish a measure of database
system performance [Bitton]. Their measure, here called the Wisconsin
benchmark, consists of a database design, a set of 32 retrieval and
update statements, and a script for multi-user tests. They give two
performance metrics: the elapsed time for each statement and the
throughput of the system when running sixteen simultaneous scripts.
No response time requirement or cost measure is included in the definition.
The Wisconsin benchmark is the most widely used database benchmark.
Largely in response to the Wisconsin benchmark, an informal group
including Bitton and Dewitt, defined a benchmark more representative
of transaction processing applications [Anon]. Its workload is: SCAN
- A mini-batch operation to sequentially copy 1000 records SORT -
A batch operation to sort one million records. DebitCredit - A short
transaction with terminal input and output via X.25, presentation
services, and a mix of five database accesses. The DebitCredit transaction
has rules for scaling the terminal network and database size as the
transaction rate increases, and also rules for distributing transactions
if the system is decentralized. The performance metrics for this
benchmark are: Elapsed time for the SCAN and SORT. Peak throughput
for the DebitCredit transaction at 1 second response time for 95%
of the transactions. This gives a TPS (Transactions Per Second) rating.
Price per transaction where price is the 5-year cost of hardware,
software and maintenance. This is sometimes called the vendors-view
of price. This benchmark has been adopted by several vendors to compare
their performance and price performance from release to release and
also to compare their performance to competitive products. MIPS,
Whetstones and MegaFLOPs have served a similar role in the scientific
community. A system's TPS rating indicates not just processor speed,
but also IO architecture, operating system, data communications and
database software performance. Unfortunately, it does not capture
ease-of-use. Work continues on formalizing these benchmarks. At present
they are written in English. Ultimately they should be defined by
a file generator and a set of programs written in a standard database
language such as COBOL-SQL. When a vendor first measures his system
against these benchmarks, the results are usually terrible. Both
benchmarks are designed to expose generic performance bugs in frequently
used transaction processing atoms. For example, the Wisconsin and
SCAN benchmarks heavily penalize a system which is slow to read the
next record in a file. A system with poor performance on these benchmarks
can be analyzed as follows: Most vendors have an “atomic” model of
their system which represents each transaction as a collection of
atoms. The atoms are the primitives of the system. For example, the
SCAN benchmark is represented by most vendors as: SCAN: BEGIN TRANSACTION
PERFORM 1000 TIMES READ SEQUENTIAL INSERT SEQUENTIAL COMMIT TRANSACTION
The atomic weights for, BEGIN, READ SEQUENTIAL, INSERT SEQUENTIAL,
and COMMIT are measured for each release. The atomic weight usually
consists of CPU instructions, message bytes, and disc IOs for a “typical”
call to that operation. These weights can be converted to service
times by knowing the speeds and utilizations of the devices (processors,
discs, lines) used for the application. The molecular weight and
service time of SCAN can then be computed as the sum of the atomic
weights. Defining and measuring a system's atoms is valuable. It
produces a simple conceptual model of how the system is used. Atomic
measurements also expose performance bugs. For example, based on
the SCAN benchmark, most systems perform READ SEQUENTIAL in 1000
instructions and with .02 disc IO. If a system uses many more instructions
or many more IO then it has a performance problem. Similarly, the
DebitCredit transaction typically consumes about 2OOKi (thousand
instructions) and five disc IO per transaction. One system is known
to use 800Ki and 14 IO per transaction. The vendor could use atomic
measurement to find the causes of such poor performance. When such
problems are localized to an atom, solutions to the problem readily
suggest themselves. So, atomic measurement is useful for performance
assurance and performance improvement. Atomic measurement also has
a major role in system sizing and in capacity planning. If the customer
can describe his application in terms of atoms, then a spreadsheet
application can give him an estimate of the CPU, disc and line cost
for the application. With substantially more effort (and assumptions)
the system's response time can be predicted. With even more effort,
a prototype system can be generated and benchmarked from the atomic
transaction descriptions. Snapshot [Stewart] and Envision [Envison]
are examples of systems which combine atomic modeling, queue modeling,
and ultimately benchmarking of real systems generated from the atomic
description of the application.",A view of database system performance measures,0

The user interface (UI) of the MEAD computer-aided control engineering
(CACE) program is presented. After a brief presentation of the MEAD
computer program, the unifying philosophy behind the MEAD UI is discussed.
Main features of this UI include a point-and-click-style interaction,
a unifying grouping of similar functionality, and a graphical interface
to its CACE database management system. A typical modeling, analysis,

using an experimental UIMS developed at GE which supports both a
Tektronix terminal and X-window-based window systems. Some implementational
features of the MEAD user interface are that it is implemented using
an object-oriented database system; that it uses a state tree to
specify the dialog control; and that it is created entirely by means
of a graphical editor, thereby avoiding conventional programming.

Current DSS research has demonstrated the viability of DSSs which

promising approaches have been tried out in practice for real-life
situations. One of the important reasons for this gap in state-of-the-art

methodology. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology based
on a life cycle model and encompassing an engineering approach to
DSS development. This approach assumes that functionality of a DSS
is a process of negotiation between the user and the builder, and
focusses on the support provided by a DSS, as this is the basic reason
for DSS development. As an engineering approach, it establishes the
standard for the level of support to be provided by the proposed
DSS in terms of task effectiveness and resource requirements. This

""In the eighth century, a sect arose from within the ranks of its
highly literate clergy that so despised images that its members declared
an all-out war against statues and paintings&hellip;. At first, they
sought out only religious images to smash. Church mosaics, painted
icons, and stained-glass artistry fell to their savage assaults.
Later their targets also included painters, sculptors and craftsmen.
They even murdered those whose crime it was to love art. Monks who
resisted were blinded and had their tongues torn out. The iconoclasts
beheaded the Patriach of the Eastern Chruch in 767 for refusing to
support their cause.""The iconoclast movement never spread to illiterate

Intelligence
This paper argues that AI follows classical versions of epistemology
in assuming that the identity of the knowing subject is not important.
In other words this serves to `delete the subject'. This disguises
an implicit hierarchy of knowers involved in the representation of
knowledge in AI which privileges the perspective of those who design
and build the systems over alternative perspectives. The privileged
position reflects Western, professional masculinity. Alternative
perspectives, denied a voice, belong to less powerful groups including
women. Feminist epistemology can be used to approach this from new
directions, in particular, to show how women's knowledge may be left
out of consideration by AI's focus on masculine subjects. The paper
uncovers the tacitly assumed Western professional male subjects in
two flagship AI systems, Cyc and Soar.","Deleting the Subject: A Feminist Reading of Epistemology in Artificial

that each view is the support of editing actions. Kaomi is flexible

It is indeed a scalable toolkit since it provides facilities for
extending and/or for modifying the resulting authoring environment.
In addition, cross-platform portability is provided which allows
operation in the heterogenous Internet environment. The use of Kaomi

37,"Language Processing Modulated by Literacy: A Network Analysis of
Verbal Repetition in Literate and Illiterate Subjects
Previous behavioral and functional neuroimaging data indicate that
certain aspects of phonological processing may not be acquired spontaneously,
but are modulated by learning an alphabetic written language, that
is, learning to read and write. It appears that learning an alphabetic
written language modifies the auditory-verbal (spoken) language processing
competence in a nontrivial way. We have previously suggested, based
on behavioral and functional neuroimaging data, that auditory-verbal
and written language interact not only during certain language tasks,
but that learning and developing alphabetic written language capacities
significantly modulates the spoken language system. Specifically,
the acquisition of alphabetic orthographic knowledge has a modulatory
influence on sublexical phonological processing and the awareness
of sublexical phonological structure. We have suggested that developing
an orthographic representation system for an alphabetic written language,
and integrating a phoneme-grapheme correspondence with an existing
infrastructure for auditory-verbal language processing, will result
in a modified language network. Specifically, we suggest that the
parallel interactive processing characteristics of the underlying
language-processing brain network differ in literate and illiterate
subjects. Therefore, the pattern of interactions between the regions
of a suitably defined large-scale functional-anatomical network for
language processing will differ between literate and illiterate subjects
during certain language tasks. In order to investigate this hypothesis
further, we analyzed the observed covariance structure in a PET data
set from a simple auditory-verbal repetition paradigm in literate
and illiterate subjects, with a network approach based on structural
equation modeling (SEM). Based on a simple network model for language
processing, the results of the present network analysis indicate
that the network interactions during word and pseudoword repetition
in the illiterate group differ, while there were no significant differences
in the literate group. The differences between the two tasks in the
illiterate group may reflect differences in attentional modulation
of the language network, executive aspects of verbal working memory
and the articulatory organization of verbal output. There were no
significant differences between the literate and illiterate group
during word repetition. In contrast, the network interactions differed
between the literate and illiterate group during pseudoword repetition.
In addition to differences similar to those observed in the illiterate
group between word and pseudoword repetition, there were differences
related to the interactions of the phonological loop between the
groups. In particular, these differences related to the interaction
between Broca's area and the inferior parietal cortex as well as
the posterior-midinsula bridge between Wernicke's and Broca's area.
In conclusion, the results of this network analysis are consistent
with our previously presented results and support the hypothesis
that learning to read and write during childhood influences the functional
architecture of the adult human brain. In particular, the basic auditory-verbal
language network in the human brain is modified as a consequence
of acquiring orthographic language skills.","Language Processing Modulated by Literacy: A Network Analysis of

It must fit into the understanding of a system, which has relational,

means that by focusing on the details, we tend to overlook the big
picture. Sometimes scientists and engineers can see the details but
miss the overall perspective. This does not have to be. We can overcome
this failing and thereby build more useful instruments. We need to
understand who uses measurement, why we measure, and how we measure.

Technology in Adult Literacy Training
This study explored whether over-the-counter continuous voice recognition
software could be used to support the delivery of a standardized
reading curriculum to adults with low-level literacy skills. Three
primary questions were addressed in the study. First, how readily
could mass-market continuous voice recognition software programs
be adapted for use in adult literacy training? Second, what role(s)
might the voice recognition technology play in facilitating the computer-based
delivery of a standard text-based reading curriculum? And third,
does the use of the voice recognition software positively affect
the technological skills and computing comfort levels of adults with
low-level literacy skills?


Five adults with low-level literacy skills completed the computer-based
curriculum, using the voice recognition software to practice and
check their reading and writing efforts. A literacy tutor guided
the participants through the curriculum, recorded and saved the participants'
responses and videotaped the sessions for subsequent analysis.


The findings reported here suggest that currently available over-the-counter
continuous voice recognition technology, while essentially effective

system, to meet the needs of these adults with low-level literacy
skills. The voice recognition software was most effective when it
was used in the presence of a tutor. Having tutors provide on-going
and immediate support to learners was a vital component of literacy
training in this computer-based environment. In general the computer-based
programs seemed to provide participants with a `motivational boost'.
Specifically, the computer-based lessons helped develop participants'
technological skills and confidence levels and promoted sustained

We present a novel, interactive shape modeling technique: dynamic
implicit solid modeling, which unifies volumetric implicit functions
and powerful physics-based modeling. Although implicit functions
are extremely powerful in graphics, geometric design, and shape modeling,
the full potential of implicit functions is yet to be fully realized
due to the lack of flexible and interactive design techniques. In
order to broaden the accessibility of implicit functions in geometric
modeling, we marry the implicit solids, which are semi-algebraic
sets of volumetric implicit functions, with the principle of physics-based
models and formulate dynamic implicit solids. By using ""density springs""
to connect the scalar values of implicit functions, we offer a viable
solution to introduce the elasticity into implicit representations.
As a result, our dynamic implicit solids respond to sculpting forces
in a natural and predictive manner. The geometric and physical behaviors
are tightly coupled in our modeling system. The flexibility of our
modeling technique allows users to easily modify the geometry and
topology of sculpted objects, while the inherent physical properties
can provide a natural interface for direct, force-based free-form
deformation. The additional constraints provide users more control
on the dynamic implicit solids. We have developed a sculpting system
equipped with a large variety of physics-based toolkits and an intuitive
haptic interface to facilitate the direct, natural editing of implicit
functions in real-time. Our experiments demonstrate many attractive

and those without. While governments have tried to lessen this divide
through the introduction of public access points and infrastructure
subsidies, little is being done to address the barriers to entry
for functionally illiterate and cognitively impaired populations.
Our research attempts to address this issue by individualizing end-user
interactions with computerized systems on a domain-specific basis.
We take the view that each end-user's system should act as a peer
in the computing environment, allowing end-users to own and control
their information. Shifting from the current client-server computing
environment to the peer-to-peer paradigm of computing should facilitate
the customization of interactions that these populations require
while maintaining their privacy. Existing applications programming
environments are geared towards the client-server model of computing.
Research into peer-to-peer application development has indicated
that the process-oriented programming environment facilitates some
aspects of peer-to-peer application development, but introduces challenges
with respect to distributed data management. Existing blocking distributed
transaction coordination mechanisms rely on global state to facilitate
centralized control of distributed resources, but there is no concept
of global state in the process-oriented model. This thesis introduces
a new model of token-based peer-to-peer interaction coordination
(the TPIC model). This new model maintains consistency in a peer-to-peer
environment without relying on global state.",Token-based peer-to-peer interaction coordination,0

An automatic word recognition system is described which assists orally
proficient literacy inefficient people to become literate within
a minimum possible timeframe. The system enables people with a strong
oral tradition to impart their stories directly in text form, without
the assistance of a learning facilitator, which is the current best
practice for such people. This project stems from work with indigenous
communities, but has far-reaching repercussions beyond this community
sector, with the potential for benefit to mainstream literacy education
(Gluck et.al., 1999). It should be emphasized that our system differs
from virtually all other speech-to-text recognition systems in that
users are not required to interact via written text (e.g. Kohonen,
1988); at the heart of the system is a neural network-based pattern
recognizer which translates speech patterns into visual rather than
textual cues. Results obtained to date using this system are reported.","A neural network, speech-based approach to literacy",1

Observational research has become an increasingly important tool in
the technical communicator's toolkit as a way of analyzing audiences,
discovering problems with current documentation systems, and envisioning
alternate ways to design information. Whether it is used informally,
in structured design methods, or in academic workplace studies, observational
research is useful for technical communication. Yet collecting, managing,

share among team members. Thus technical communicators sometimes
avoid observational research in favor of interviews, focus groups,

that are no substitute for observational research.In this presentation,
I describe two projects in which I dealt with some of these barriers
by using handheld PCs (a Handspring Visor and a Sharp Zaurus) as

techniques to a handheld PC -particularly on the data collection
side -- leads to a number of benefits, including a reduction in laborious

This paper considers the additional uses of CALL in the Endangered

for ELs in general. It then reviews the extra uses of CALL for ELs;
these include changing negative attitudes towards the language, arousing
interest in the language and contributing to language maintenance
and documentation. In order to demonstrate the benefits of CALL for
an EL, three examples are presented. Each of the ELs discussed in
this paper could be considered to be on a different scale on the
Fishman (1991) Scale for an EL. The first CALL application discussed
is a program for Irish for primary school children. Irish is a Celtic
language and is only regularly used by about 10,000 speakers in Ireland.
The main aim of the program was to try to increase the children’s
motivation to study Irish, which is a compulsory subject in schools
in Ireland. The second application is a literacy program for Tojolab’al,
a Mayan language spoken in Chiapas, Mexico. Tojolab’al could be considered
to be a relatively stable language (30,000–40,000 speakers out of
an ethnic population of about 80,000 people), but it has very few
literate speakers. The idea of this project was to develop CALL courseware
to teach literacy, beginning with the letters and then progressing
to words and phrases. The third example is CALL courseware for Nawat,
an Uto-Aztecan language of El Salvador. The remaining 150 speakers
of Nawat are mainly elderly and illiterate and this courseware aimed
to document and develop courseware for the language, while the remaining
speakers were still alive. The paper concludes with lessons learnt
for ELs in general from these three specific examples. It surmises
that despite the difficulties involved in the CALL for EL context,
if a pragmatic approach is adopted, CALL materials can have positive
social benefits, which probably outweigh its contribution to language

This paper discusses work carried in the context of a study addressing
the design and development of a wearable communication aid for people
who are illiterate and cannot speak. People with such disabilities
often depend on electronic augmentative and alternative communication
devices for interpersonal communication. A central theme of the paper,
however, is that such products, and products intended for people
with disabilities more generally, have characteristics that inadequately
attend to users’ needs—in particular many devices pay insufficient
regard to the psychological and sociological impact the devices have
upon their users. The paper briefly discusses an empirical case study
targeted to design and develop the Portland Communication Aid (PCA).
The process of establishing user requirements, and in particular
the notion of designer-facilitated participatory design, is discussed.

Alongside good governance, technology is considered among the greatest
enablers for improved quality of life. However, the majority of its
benefits have been concentrated in industrialized nations and therefore
limited to a fraction of the world's population. We believe that
technology has a large role to play in developing regions, that ""First
World"" technology to date has been a poor fit in these areas, and
that there is thus a need for technology research for developing
regions. Despite the relative infancy of technology studies in developing
regions, anecdotal evidence suggests that access to technology has
a beneficial economic impact. Cellular telephony is probably the
most visible application, but there are many others, some of which
we cover in this article. The World Bank's infoDev site catalogs
hundreds of information and communications technologies (ICT) projects,
albeit not all successful. Most of these projects use existing off-the-shelf
technology designed for the industrialized world. Although it is
clear that there are large differences in assumptions related to
cost, power, and usage, there has been little work on how technology
needs in developing regions differ from those of industrialized nations.

developing regions accidentally at best.",The case for technology in developing regions,1

This research explores the reasons why electronic commerce practices
have diffused around the world at the national level of analysis,
due to forces that are both internal and external to the countries
in which diffusion is observed to occur. We propose two related growth
theories that contribute contrasting viewpoints about the origins
of the drivers of diffusion: endogenous growth theory and exogenous
growth theory. We use the former theory to argue that the primary
drivers of diffusion stem from economic forces that are internal
to a country, including its government policies (e.g., tax on online
stores), wealth, infrastructure, readiness, education levels, and
so on. The latter theory suggests that the primary drivers are external
to the economy, and may reflect the forces present in the regional
economy, international drivers of technological change, trade flows

and Third World realities
Defined as the differential degree to which rich and poor countries
benefit from new information and communications technologies such
as the Internet, the global digital divide is widely measured by
international institutions in terms of the number of persons with
individual access to those technologies. Yet, while this measure
makes sense in the rich countries, where individual ownership is
widespread among the population, it makes very little sense in poor
countries. For, in the latter, what we find is that although individual
access is indeed very limited, a remarkable number of local innovations
ensure that the benefits of the Internet are made available to at
least 10 million people throughout the Third World. Many such persons
are illiterate, unskilled and resident in the rural areas of developing
countries. These findings directly contradict the commonly held notion
that there are few, if any, local innovations in the applications
of the Internet outside the rich countries and those parts of poorer
countries with close connections to the former (most typically through
multinational corporations). From a policy point of view, we suggest
that foreign aid donors and national governments pay less attention

Networked appliances are consumer or household devices with a network
interface which allows them to he connected to a (home) network.
Networked appliances offer major benefits compared to their conventional
equivalent. Software services can operate upon an array of these
appliances to offer value added functionality. In this case the user
interface to control the appliances will be inadequate. Commonly
networked appliances may either he controlled using the traditional
user interface, such as switches and buttons on the device, or alternatively
using a PC based interface. Traditional user interfaces often cannot
support the full functionality offered by the appliance. The PC based
interfaces tend to be too complicated for the average user and enables
the PC based interface to be suitable and available in many situations.
Therefore a user interface which supports the new functionalities
and is easy to use is required. In this paper, Anoto functionality
enabled pen and paper are suggested as a suitable interface. Pen
and paper are well known to all users and suitable paper forms make
it straightforward to fully control and program networked appliances
without a PC interface. Thus an important barrier to the acceptance
of networked appliances is broken. Furthermore, the presented approach
can be used to integrate the control of multiple appliances and services.

We propose a system architecture for real-time hardware speech recognition
on low-cost, power-constrained devices. The system is intended to
support real-time speech-based user interfaces as part of an effort
to bring information and communication technologies (ICTs) to underdeveloped
regions of the world. Our system architecture exploits a shared infrastructure
model. The computationally intensive task of speech model training
and retraining is performed offline by shared servers, while the
actual recognition of speech is conducted on low-cost hand-held devices
using custom hardware. The recognizer is extremely flexible and can
support multiple languages or dialects with speaker-independent recognition.
Dynamic loading of speech models is used for changing language grammar
and retraining, while reprogramming is used to support evolution
of recognition algorithms. The focus on small sets of words (at one
time) reduces the complexity, cost and power consumption. We design
the speech decoder, the central component of the recognizer, and
we validate it via a prototype FPGA implementation. We then use ASIC
synthesis to estimate power and size for the design. Our evaluations
demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement in power compared with
optimized recognition software running on a low-power embedded general-purpose
processor of the same technology and of similar capabilities. The
synthesis also estimates the area of the design to be about 2.5mm,

projects, which have shown PV could be both reliable and cost effective
in remote rural areas, over previous 10-year period, CEMIG-Energetic
Company of Minas Gerais (the largest utility in Brazil) has developed
a PV rural-electrification program that is driven by quality-of-life
improvement objectives for the electricity consumer. The Luz no Saber
has been specifically designed inside a larger-scale rural electrification
program (Luz para Todos - M.G.). It has been implemented in rural
areas of Minas Gerais State by CEMIG, in collaboration with state
and federal governments. The main objective has been to find an energy
delivery alternative to grid connection for dispersed rural communities
to realize the recent ""Universal Attendance Law"" (10438). That is,
starting July, 2002, electric utilities in Brazil have been required
to electrify the entire areas they serve. Because of solar resource
availability and geographical constraints, PV is the most important
complementary technology to satisfy the universal electrical delivery
to rural and remote communities in Minas Gerais. The technology allows
the access of lower-income people to lighting, communication, as
well as a variety of educational delivery opportunities. A major
impact has been reducing illiteracy and improving the quality of
education. The major conclusion of this 10-year CEMIG investment
is that an adequate service infrastructure is required to make projects
viable, mainly characterized by a technical network which guarantees
the system's technical performance, system design, qualified technical
support, and also avoids a lack of unreasonable and unfulfilled user

This paper presents a project currently underway in the Eastern Cape
province of South Africa. The project is aimed at providing solutions
for underprivileged and disadvantaged communities, to help solve
some of their needs by creating localized computer-based solutions
based on indigenous knowledge. This would help bridge the digital
divide, as these computer solutions are closer to the local users.
The project entails studying the community in question and understanding
their way of life and then develop software solutions that use features
that they are familiar with and use their language. The project asks
the community to partake in the development of the solution and then
reap benefits from whatever revenue stream the project would enable.
An added benefit is that we should be able to preserve the cultural
aspects of the community while bringing forth best class modernity.
Key areas that the project affects are: education, music, artworks,

In the fragile reading cultures of the developing world, will people
abandon print as they embrace the Internet? Whether media compete

online practices into a local context of material circumstances,
social roles, and cultural values. In Nigeria and Ghana these include
(1) unreliable electricity and execrable telephone service; (2) overworked
women, jobless young men, scammers, and ambitious teenagers; and
(3) a reading culture of limited penetration but enormous prestige.
Internet access via cybercafés has intensified personal communications,
reinforced gender inequality, and enabled petty crooks to go global.
It has not, however, encroached on reading's all-but-sacred status.

regions
Computer-aided learning is fast gaining traction in developing regions
as a means to augment classroom instruction. Reasons for using computer-aided
learning range from supplementing teacher shortages to starting underprivileged
children off in technology, and funding for such initiatives range
from state education funds to international agencies and private
groups interested in child development. The interaction of children
with computers is seen at various levels, from unsupervised self-guided
learning at public booths without specific curriculum to highly regulated
in-class computer applications with modules designed to go with school
curriculum. Such learning is used at various levels from children
as young as 5 year-old to high-schoolers. This paper uses field observations
of primary school children in India using computer-aided learning
modules, and finds patterns by which children who perform better
in classroom activities seat themselves in front of computer monitors,
and control the mouse, in cases where children are required to share
computer resources. We find that in such circumstances, there emerges
a pattern of learning, unique to multi-user environments - wherein
certain children tend to learn better because of their control of
the mouse. This research also shows that while computer aided learning
software for children is primarily designed for single-users, the
implementation realities of resource-strapped learning environments

It's important to consider both primary and secondary users when designing
for intermediated interaction scenarios in India and elsewhere in
the developing world. However, most of this research has focused
on supporting users in the developed world who are voluntarily collaborating
on a computing task. Many users in India, especially those from disadvantaged
classes, have only partial or no physical access to computing devices.
We refer to these users as secondary users to distinguish them from
the primary users that the interface design process traditionally
considers. Secondary users must interact with information resources
via a proxy primary user who has the required access rights and skills.
The proxy's filtering and funneling decisions limit the secondary
users' information-seeking behavior; the secondary user might also
have an unequal power relationship with the proxy. Therefore, secondary
users might never know the full scope of actions and knowledge available
to them. If we are to realize the egalitarian potential of computing,
we must consider secondary users in the design process. We must develop
technologies that recognize the needs and aspirations of all classes
of users, including those without direct access to the user interface.

tasks, both primary and secondary users can benefit.","Understanding and designing for intermediated information tasks in

177,"Taking e-government to the bottom of the pyramid: dial-a-gov?
Much attention has been paid to the use of ICTs to improve the delivery
of government services to citizens in developing countries. Government
and donor funds have adopted two strategies in parallel: (i) the
re-engineering and automating of government services, and (ii) the
installation of telecenters (community Internet access centers) for
citizens to access reengineered government ""e-Gov"" services.


The model of delivering e-Gov via the Internet has major drawbacks
as shown by survey data representing 397 million people at the Bottom
of the Pyramid (BOP) in India, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka and
Thailand. First, only 49% have even heard of the Internet and only
2.6% have used it [15]. Second, it will take a lot more time and
significant funds to roll-out enough telecenters to cover the BOP
sufficiently. Third, most telecenters fail, while the successful
ones are sustained by revenues from non-Internet services such as
voice calls, fax and photocopying. But even these revenue streams
may dwindle - according to our survey, over 40% of current BOP non-owners
plan to purchase a phone within 2 years. They will spend their already-limited
communications budgets on phones they own, not at a telecenter.


By viewing the telephone as the end-device for e-service delivery,
implementers can automate those parts of a government process that
can deliver value quickly, through ""smaller"" (less complicated, therefore
less likely to fail) applications. By not seeking to re-engineer
entire government departments, these projects face less resistance
to change from public-sector employees. Given that over 90% of those
at the BOP use phones already [15], significant use is more likely
if the necessary attention is paid to language, design and publicity.


The Internet, accessed at a telecenter, and sophisticated e-Government
systems will play a role in providing ""higher-end"" citizen services,
for example submitting a passport application online with an uploaded
digital photograph. But at a time when the Internet is barely reaching
10.3 million people at the BOP in these countries, the paper argues
that phones are the cheaper, more immediate and ubiquitous tool for
Asian governments to inform, transact and interact with almost 400
million of their most needy citizens.


The paper presents an alternative, telephone-centric model for electronic
delivery of public services citizens. It draws on research conducted
by LIRNEasia in 2006 and previously published as well as unpublished

179,"A growth theory perspective on B2C e-commerce growth in Europe: An
exploratory study
Information and communication technologies (ICTs) continue to have
a profound effect on the economies and societies where they are used.
In this article, we propose three related theories to describe the
underlying mechanism for growth in e-commerce revenues at the national
level. Endogenous growth theory posits that the primary drivers of
e-commerce growth are internal to a country. Exogenous growth theory
suggests that the primary drivers of e-commerce growth are external
to an economic system, and reflect the forces of the regional economy.
A blend of these, a mixed endogenous-exogenous growth theory, incorporates
drivers from both the economy and the region of a country. We test
a number of hypotheses about e-commerce growth in the context of
these theories. The key variables include Internet penetration, telecommunication
investment intensity, venture capital and credit card availability,
and education level. The data are drawn from 17 European countries
over a five-year period from 2000 to 2004, and are analyzed using
panel data regression with robust error terms, a variant of weighted
least squares. The results show the differential efficacy of internal
and external drivers as endogenous and exogenous precursors of e-commerce
growth across the countries for a number of different modeling specifications.
We conclude with a discussion of alternative approaches to model
e-commerce growth in a country. The results also suggest the appropriateness
of exploring models of regional contagion for e-commerce growth.","A growth theory perspective on B2C e-commerce growth in Europe: An

analyze and synthesize the information retrieved); and “information
ability” (ability to assess the quality of information). Additionally,
there are technical barriers, such as Internet access speed, which
influence user's behaviors when searching for information. Finally,

196,"Efficiency of electronic public service delivery in India: public-private
partnership as a critical factor
The dynamics of public administration in India have altered drastically
with the introduction of e-governance as a guiding concept in the
late 1980s. Citizens, the world over, have been demanding smaller,
effective and responsive governments, obviously inspired by the unprecedented
and rapid success of finance capital in the global market. Consequently,
policy makers began the search for smaller and efficient governments.
On an evolutionary plane, reengineering of service systems, performance
management, transparency in government operations, down sizing or
right sizing the government workforce, emphasis on delivery of reliable
public services and ultimately citizen satisfaction came to be considered
as benchmarks by most of the administrators. Quick decision-making,
data-based planning, effective implementation through quantitative
techniques seemed to have clinched the issue. This reformative pattern
was no different in the Indian context, where the governments at
the federal and state levels were in search of new techniques and
technologies.


Information technology has been found to be very useful in reinvigorating
the government administrative systems by enhancing their capacity
and efficiency. The potential and scope for application of IT in
governing processes and transactions are enormous. E-government can
transform traditional administrative systems through employment of
information and communication technologies. A governance system that
is committed to working with civil society, and by extension, private
industry in a transparent and accountable way to reduce poverty,
redress imbalances in access to resources, foster security and uphold
social, economic, cultural, civil and political rights is the ultimate
objective of e-governance theory. In practice, much depends on the
collaboration patterns that the governments seek to establish.


E-governance practices in India emerged and evolved mainly from native
intuition, but under prescription for lesser and transparent government
by international financial institutions, mainly the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund. However, the range of success of
e-governance initiatives has not been uniform. The bottom-up demand
for delivery of electronic services was bleak initially, but the
change in public perception was for the better with the governments
roping in private industry and service-oriented organizations gradually.


The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model as is construed normally
in a world that is fast witnessing globalization of all businesses
and administrative trends, especially in the realm of e-governance,
involves features such lesser government investment in electronic
delivery of public services, collaboration in conceptualizing, designing
and implementing the e-governance projects besides increased participation
of stakeholders -- both private and public -- to saturate the levels
and the reach of such projects. India is no exception to the general
rule dictating PPP mode in e-governance.


The unprecedented success of the PPP modules in e-governance in India
can be rightly established with two path-breaking e-governance models
- e-Seva in the state of Andhra Pradesh and Bhoomi in Karnataka.
These projects not only caused a jump in revenue collections of the
two state governments, but also timely payment by the citizens. Time
and costs for availing public services have come down drastically
bringing in a positive change in peoples' perception of e-governance
theory and practice. This holds equally true for both the rural and
urban populace. The result of all these radical changes in public
administration systems is the enhanced satisfaction level of the
citizenry on delivery of public services and simplification of governmental
procedures. The above mentioned e-government projects can serve as
models for all the developing societies.","Efficiency of electronic public service delivery in India: public-private

In India women's ability to participate in the country's rapid progress

The digital battle has become the most important factor of economic
and social development. In fact, there is no doubt on the fact that
establishing E-government systems can improve the quality of government
services and enhance the citizens' life. However, E-government projects
cannot be successful if they are not adapted to the specific cultural
and social needs of the users.


Taking into consideration the high illiteracy rate within the Moroccan
population, we conducted our research to design an E-government portal
for the old city of Fez that is accessible by the majority of the
citizens especially those who are illiterate.


The objective of this research is exploring the different architectures,
scenarios and technologies for designing an E-government portal that
is usable and accessible by all Fez citizens whether they are literate
or illiterate. Hence, the concrete output of this project is a usable
graphical user interface accessible to both literate and illiterate
people in order for them to interact with the static content and
to use the online transactions. In the process of achieving our goal,
we had to discover and create design principles and to test them
with real users.

and tools that were applied in order to develop Fez e-government
portal's graphical user interface. The results of the designed graphical
user interface's testing are presented and discussed in order to

validity index type
Clustering techniques are widely used to give insight about the similarities/dissimilarities
between data set items. Most algorithms require the user to tune
parameters such as number of clusters or threshold for cut-off point
in a dendrogram. Such parameters also affect the clustering quality.
In a good quality cluster, the intra-cluster similarity should be
high, whereas the inter-cluster similarity should be low. To determine
the optimal cluster number, several cluster validity methods have
been proposed. However, there is no guideline with respect to which
clustering validity methods can be used in conjunction with which
clustering algorithms. In this paper, Dunn and SD validity indices
were applied to Kohonen self organizing maps, k-means and agglomerative
clustering algorithms and their limitations were shown empirically.","The effect of data set characteristics on the choice of clustering

rural communities into the knowledge society
With the information revolution that promises to shape the 21st century,
knowledge has become the prime commodity, very much like land, means
of production and capital have been at different times in the past.
Access to information, made instantly available by the growth of
the Internet, determines access to economic resources, social participation
and better quality of life. For this reason, the knowledge stored
on the Web and the advantages offered by the spread of Information
and Communication Technology (ICT) are equally important for rich
societies to prosper and for poor ones to develop. The only difference
is that marginalised communities do not have access to the tools
and have little control over the content found in the domain of ICTs.
In this paper we describe an intervention to develop the potential
of a typical rural community in South Africa through ICTs. This involves
providing Internet connectivity and deploying a platform to support
e-commerce, e-learning, e-government and e-health. The core of the
platform is an ontology-based model designed to integrate and respond
to Indigenous Knowledge Systems. This has been achieved by combining
a deep understanding of local knowledge and social networks with
the use of authoring, communication and ontology-management tools.
The primary goal of this new approach is to find a way to make ICT
solutions more sensitive to the local context, and therefore more
effective. Secondly, we hope to foster a sense of ownership of the
project among the community, by capitalising on local knowledge and
resources.","An ontology-based, multi-modal platform for the inclusion of marginalized

Information Retrieval on the WWW is important because it is hard to
find what one is looking for. There is a plethora of information
available, and searching relevant information is a challenge. In
the case of developing regions, we have the opposite problem: 1)
Information availability of global markets is scarce. Most of the
consumers and producers (of information as well as goods) are relegated
to local markets in geographical vicinity. In order to reach wider
markets, it is important for this local information to reach wider
audiences. (Local information for global consumption LIG model).
(2) At the same time, locally relevant information, such as delays
in bus/train timings, mobile medical van schedule changes, electricity
outage timings, is not easily available either. (Local information
for local consumption LIL model). We introduce the term Information
Uptrieval to address the reverse problem of acquiring, assimilating,
aggregating and uploading global and local information that is relevant
for developing regions to a platform that improves the reach of the
information. While the WWW is an obvious example of one such platform,
given the low internet penetration in such regions, we need to explore
effective alternatives. Several innovative, but disconnected approaches
have been attempted to address the information uptrieval problem,
ranging from the use of DVDs (eSagu, http://www.esagu.in/esagu) through

of terrestrial TV in Brazil
The digital divide has numerous aspects and is as dynamic as the technology
industry is able to develop and disseminate new ICTs and services,
thus increasing or creating new gaps among the more advanced societies
and those still hampered by social and economic problems. In developing
countries the diffusion of new technologies is often hindered by
factors such as insufficient income, deficient infrastructure, cultural
barriers and lack of information. Brazil is no exception to that
rule, and all information and communication technologies (ICT) diffusion
surveys undertaken to date confirm the trend that digital exclusion
is following the dreadful pattern of social exclusion. The income
disparities in Brazil are very severe and, also due to the country's
huge territory and complex geographical and cultural formations,
a technological innovation is seldom capable of reaching the population
as a whole and benefiting the entire society. One outstanding exception
is the terrestrial (free-to-air) TV, which, after about 50 years
since its introduction, has reached an adoption rate of more than
90%, and now covers the whole country, with enormous sociocultural
consequences. In view of this, and with the objective of addressing
the problem of digital exclusion, the Brazilian Government has devised
the deployment of digital terrestrial television-DTT-as a singular
opportunity to reduce the digital divide and to promote the access
of the population to interactive and citizenship services through
an already familiar interface, thus avoiding or reducing cultural
constraints and illiteracy barriers usually posed by other ICTs.
This study undertakes a comprehensive discussion of that policy and
its effects, and provides some data to support the strategy: the
results of two interrelated studies; one that maps TV users' characteristics
and expectations regarding digital TV, and another that models the
social network effects on the diffusion of DTT into Brazilian society
and the users' behavior when facing the new media, namely, an agent-based
modeling and simulation-ABMS. The model uses the mapping information
as input to test some hypothetical scenarios in the diffusion process,
so as to identify factors that affect the overall diffusion process.

Findings from inner-city adolescents and prisoners
Two studies were conducted to identify individual characteristics
that predict behavioral responses to violence prevention interventions.
These studies used embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to create
hypothetical social situations (called virtual vignettes) to assess
interpersonal competency skills. One study was of male inner-city
African-American adolescents, and the second was of male prisoners
in a state correctional system. In pre- and post-intervention sessions,
participants interacted with an ECA that tried to entice them into
making risky decisions. The virtual vignette sessions tested participants'
negotiation and conflict resolution skills. Results showed differing
tendencies for participants to be engaged by the virtual vignettes.
The vignettes were sufficiently realistic to elicit differences in
behavior among the adolescents, but generally not for the prisoners.
Prior acceptance, accessibility, and usability data suggest that
most users readily accept ECAs as valid conversational partners.
The evidence presented here suggests that the technology - or the
setting in which the technology is used - is not by itself sufficient

extracted from the images. The Bengali OCR system takes the textual
information as an input to recognize individual Bengali characters.
The Bengali OCR is implemented using Multi layer Perceptron. The
output of the Bengali OCR system is compared with the previously
enrolled standard Bengali textual road signs. The throughput which
comes from the matching process is used as input for the speech synthesizer
and finally the system delivers the audio stream to the driver, either
in Bengali or in English based on the user settings. After testing
this system, the obtained accuracy rate was evaluated at 91.48%.","Real time road sign recognition system using artificial neural networks

238,"The aAQUA Approach: Innovative Web 2.0 Tools for Developing Countries
As in many regions of the world, people in rural India often lack
access to knowledge that's more readily available to people in urban
areas. Although rural telecenters are becoming more common, developing
content that's presented in local languages, relevant to users, and
delivered in an immediately usable form is a challenge here and in
rural areas across the globe. To address this, an agricultural portal
for rural farmers in India uses innovative database systems and information
retrieval techniques. In so doing, it both improves service and addresses
connection costs and constraints.",The aAQUA Approach: Innovative Web 2.0 Tools for Developing Countries,0

Internet telephony is a novel and cheaper method of communication
and conducting business over the Internet. The paper presents an
overview of Internet telephony, its methods, viz. PC-to-PC, PC-to-telephone,
telephone-to-telephone and telephone-to-PC; benefits in cost advantage,
simplification, consolidation, higher efficiency and reliability,
etc., quality issues, protocols and drivers; challenges and regulatory
framework; and status of Internet telephony in Asia Pacific region.
Further, highlights its potentiality for India, implications of guidelines
of Internet telephony, issues of concern, etc. Concludes that Internet
telephony cannot make compromises in voice quality, reliability,
scalability and manageability, and work seamlessly with telephone
systems all over the world. Internet telephony will prove to be a
boon for a price-sensitive market like India and rural telephony
will receive an impetus. The Government of India may further deregulate
the market and allow phone-to-phone telephony through the Internet
and open long distance calling within the country for ISPs to realize
''telecom for the common man'' or ''telecom for all'' a reality.",Internet telephony in India,0

In this paper we present Ñuu Xaa, a tin collecting bank to support
homeless people's self-subsistence in the city of Huajuapan de León.
The main goal of this system is to improve homeless people's quality
of life by providing them with the opportunity to have remunerative
self-employment. We think that the implementation of Ñuu Xaa will
bring homeless people social, economical and psychological benefits
because they will be able to earn enough money in order to satisfy
their elementary needs and the community will understand that homeless
people aren't lazy but just people in need.","\, {N}uu Xaa: a system to support homeless people's self-subsistence",0

242,"Coping with somatic illnesses in online support groups: Do the feared
disadvantages actually occur?
People in stressful circumstances, such as serious health conditions,
often turn to support groups. With the increase in the availability
and popularity of the Internet, the possibility has arisen to join
support groups online. Various authors have raised potential disadvantages
of these groups, such as the lack of control of the quality of the
information that is exchanged and the concern that the exchange within
the group might include socially inappropriate remarks. In this study
we explored to what extent these potential disadvantages actually
occur. In addition, we explored who uses Dutch online support groups
and what is exchanged by the participants. By means of ''content
analysis'' we analyzed a random sample of 1500 messages from publicly
available online support groups for patients with breast cancer,
arthritis and fibromyalgia. It appeared that the online support groups
under study were mainly used by female patients. A major part of
the postings contained ''off topic'' remarks. Popular health related
topics were ''restrictions in daily life'' and ''regular medication''.
Only in a minor proportion of the postings, potential disadvantages
were present. Therefore this study suggests that online support groups
are a viable option for support.","Coping with somatic illnesses in online support groups: Do the feared

243,"Supporting reflective web searching in elementary schools
In this contribution, two design experiments are presented in which
reflective web searching is implemented in six elementary classrooms.
Reflective web searching is viewed to comprise three steps: (1) develop
ownership over search questions, (2) interpret and personalize web
content, and (3) adapt web content into personally meaningful answers.
A portal and a worksheet supported reflective web searching. A wide
range of qualitative data, including observations, interviews and
group products, was collected to gain insight in the emerging practices.
The findings show that the portal and worksheet successfully contributed
to the development of ownership, and the interpretation and personalization
of retrieved information. Enabling children to search the web collaboratively
further enhanced interpretation and personalization. The prototypes
of both portal and worksheet were improved across the design experiments,
and their success rates increased. Despite the improvements, the
process of adaptation was not sufficiently supported by the portal
and worksheet.",Supporting reflective web searching in elementary schools,0

Family is a core element of society. The development of economics
and the transformation of cultures in mainland China bring new challenges
to family communications. To understand current practices and the
needs of family communication in mainland China, we studied 27 rural
and urban families with ethnographic methods. We summarized the main
family structures for rural and urban families and also found three
main family communication problems: emotional communication, the
education of children and elder support. These three problems exist
in both rural and urban areas, but in different forms. Two concepts,
an emotional poster in village and a learning community based on
family/village clan, were designed and presented to address the problems.",User study on family communication in China,0
245,"Inside the source selection process: Selection criteria for human
information sources
Co-workers are an important source of information in organizations.
Consequently, information managers seek to facilitate the use of
such human information sources. Although various studies about what
influences the use of human information sources in organizations
exist, it is difficult for information managers to utilize insights
from this research body. The studies have provided contradictory
results regarding the role of accessibility and quality and suffer
from various weaknesses. To address these weaknesses, several studies
are employing other research methods. This study aims to contribute
to the methodological development of this emerging new line of research
by exploring the value of a think aloud approach to such studies.
In addition, it aims to provide more insight into the role of accessibility
and quality in the selection of human information sources in organizations.
Fifty-six employees from four governmental organizations were asked
to think aloud while selecting human information sources. The findings
of this study corroborate those of studies taking a similar approach:
source quality is the most dominant factor in the selection of human
information sources. The think aloud approach seems a valuable contribution
to available research methods to assess the role of accessibility
and quality in human source selection in organizations.","Inside the source selection process: Selection criteria for human

246,"The Mechanics of Internet Growth: A Developing-Country Perspective
The uneven diffusion of the Internet across countries reinforces social
and economic inequalities. Correlation studies associate its uneven
diffusion with such factors as competition, telephone infrastructure,
literacy, economic development, access charges, and network reliability,
but they do not reveal the mechanics of Internet diffusion because
it is the interplay of different factors, not any factor in isolation,
that generates diffusion behavior. This paper uses the system dynamics
(SD) methodology to develop a causal model of Internet diffusion
in a developing country. The SD methodology was selected because
its basic construct, the feedback loop, is well suited to represent
the mechanics driving dynamic processes. The proposed causal model
is validated using Internet subscriber data from India. The technique
of dominant loop analysis identifies the feedback loops that have
the most influence on diffusion behavior. The model can be used to
evaluate diffusion patterns resulting from different policy alternatives
intended to foster Internet diffusion in developing countries.",The Mechanics of Internet Growth: A Developing-Country Perspective,0
